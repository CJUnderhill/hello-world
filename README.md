# hello-world
This is my first repository!

As of the creation of this file, I am a First-year CS major at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This file was made as part of the "Hello World" GitHub tutorial, as I'm currently exploring version control in an effort to integrate it into my everyday programming toolbox.

(6/1/2016) Still working on it!
